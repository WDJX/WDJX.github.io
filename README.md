Welcome to my new repo for my website!

I have decided to release the files for my website, for following reasons:
	1. To demonstrate my skills in web development
	2. To engage my peers into any potential opportunities for improvement of my website, by committing

Although the frameworks (BootStrap) is open source and is free for use by all,
I would like to mention that the photos and the resources that are used in website are copyrighted materials,
created by myself. DO NOT duplicate/redistribute the resources, and if you have any questions,
please feel free to contact me, through following email address: davidj0610@gmail.com

Thanks!

Woojin J. (David)
