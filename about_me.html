          <p>Software, Embedded Programming, CAD Design, Robotics, Mechanical Systems Design, Electrical, Automobiles, Aviation, Automation</p>
          <p>I am always full of eager to learn new things and improve myself, through various experiences. I also do some things that are "non-engineering". That list includes: music - piano, guitar, drum  ;  arts - photography, graphic design  ;  living - cleaning and cooking</p>
          <p> You can see my engineering as well as "non-engineering" portfolios on this website. Feel free to have a look! </p>

              <p class="card-text">I've been interested in aviation industries for more than 10 years. Started with a simple interest which led me to have a plane spotting hobby, now I'm also into some technical aspects of the aircrafts. I enjoy listening to the engine startup and spool-up sound of GE90-115B engines mounted on Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. I sometimes even listen to the sound when I'm studying, and it indeed helps! </p>

              <p class="card-text">It hasn't been a long time since I have realized I have a good arts skill. I was actively involved in a graphic design team where I was asked to produce various designs for school merchandises of my high school. I produced designs for t-shirts, snapbacks, pants, agendas and even a portion of school website's graphics. I also like to go out and take photos of everything.</p>
