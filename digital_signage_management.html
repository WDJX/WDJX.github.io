          <h3 class="my-3">Project Description</h3>
          <p>It is very common to see digital signages at eateries, universities, company lounges, hospitals and more. There are a lot of different free/paid solutions that will organize the contents of what will be displayed through customers' screens. However, for small business owners and organizations who don't have enough ability to hire professional web developer, it is very difficult to use most of the existing solutions. Thus, I decided to build up an open source CMS(Content Management System) that will easily guide people to make amazing and useful digital signage with minimal effort.</p>

          <h3 class="my-3">Technical Details</h3>
          <p>I will be utilizing following technical specifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML/CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>BootStrap</li>
            <li>Drupal</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class = "my-3">Project Timeframe</h3>
          <p>This project has officially launched in December 2017. I'm expecting a minimum of 1 year to get the system fully functional.</p>
          <p>The progress of this project will constantly be updated below, on a bi-monthly basis</p>

        <h3 class="my-4">February 2018</h3>
        <p>Due to the midterm exams and personal reasons, I could not make time commitment as planned, but I managed to get some
        outline covered:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I have finished analyzing code used for Xibo, and am currently looking for the best way to implement into the technical specification I have defined.</li>
          <li>I'm currently doing a lot of research regarding Drupal so that I can complete installation of Drupal 7 on my test server by mid-March.</li>
          <li>More details will come.....</li>
          <li>Making draft versions of graphic designs that will be used for UI/UX</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I am very excited, as by mid-March the brief testing conditions are likely be established, so please stay tuned!</p>


        <h3 class="my-4">January 2018</h3>
        <p>At this moment, I started to build the basic structure and analyze the code that is used for xibo, an open-source digital signage management solution. Here are key points that are now on progress:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Analyzing code that is used for Xibo that is available for download <a href="https://github.com/xibosignage/xibo">here</a></li>
          <li>Learning basic structure of frameworks including BootStrap, Node.js and others as needed</li>
          <li>Learning basic web programming skills including JavaScript, PHP, and so on</li>
          <li>Making draft versions of graphic designs that will be used for UI/UX</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This month will not have a lot of progress that can be seen externally, but rather this month will be a great time for me to build a fundamental skillset to make more reliable and strong web management system that can successfully be used for Digital Signage Management Solution!</p>

        
        <h3 class="my-4">December 2017</h3>
        <p>Due to final exams, I could not work on this too much although this idea came up in late November. However, after the final exams I was able to do some research over the holiday break. Here are the things that I decided:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I will start by modifying the code for the open-source digital signage system called <a href="https://www.xibo.org.uk/">Xibo</a></li>
          <li>After changing the basic interface, I will integrate a new CMS system that is based on Drupal.</li>
          <li>After integrating Drupal CMS, additional graphic work will be done based on Bootstrap and/or other extra framework as needed.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>More details will come up next month!</p>
